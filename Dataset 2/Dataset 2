The dataset comprises 13,792 sound recordings, distributed among three types of Beehive buzz anomalies: 5,473 Bee samples, 3,458 NoBee samples, and 4,861 NoQueen samples. The "NoBee" category captures ambient sounds during periods without bee activity, allowing external noises to be heard. When a queen bee is either old or ailing, resulting in reduced pheromonal emissions, or when she dies, ceasing pheromonal signals completely, worker bees quickly begin to rear new queens from the available young larvae within a 12-24 hour window. If there is no queen and no young larvae, the colony rapidly declines as the worker bees stop their activities. In such cases, the only sounds within the hive are those of ambient or external origin, indicating either a colony collapse or the commencement of new queen rearing. The dataset is partitioned into subsets for training, testing, and validation, divided into ratios of 80\%, 20\%, and 10\%, respectively.
