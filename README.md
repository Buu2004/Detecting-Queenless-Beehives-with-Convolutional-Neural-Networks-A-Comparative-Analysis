# Detecting-Queenless-Beehives-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-A-Comparative-Analysis

Detecting the queenless state in beehives is crucial for effective hive management and maintaining colony health. This study aims to identify a robust and generalizable 2D convolutional network structure for this task by evaluating four CNN models: RegNet, EfficientNet, AlexNet, and ResNet-50. Using two distinct datasets with low-frequency STFT and MFCC spectrograms as input, we assessed the models' performance. RegNet achieved the highest accuracy, 96.4\% on one dataset and 92.46\% on the other, due to its optimized design and efficient training. EfficientNet also performed well, with accuracies of 96.33\% and 90.32\%, leveraging its compound scaling approach. In contrast, ResNet-50 and AlexNet struggled to generalize, with significant drops in accuracy between the datasets. Our findings suggest that RegNet is the most effective model for detecting the queenless state, offering a promising solution for beekeeping applications. Future research should focus on further optimization and exploring additional regularization techniques to enhance model performance.
